For dataset1:
1. I have used plotly library to plot the graph
2. The map is stores in variable p_plot
3. Steps to run:
	a.install.packages('plotly')
	b.source('dataset1.R')
	c.p_plot

For dataset2:
1. For dataset2 my labels are: labl,bwld,mgcd
2. imported .txt into sql tables
3. Tables created: labl,bwld,mgcd
4. Provide to ways to find date corresponding to max change
5. Run the dataset2.sql file

For dataset3:
1.The .csv file is missing headers so while doing mongoimport it gave error.
2. I ran a script in R which took the csv, converted it to data frame and wrote back the csv. This added the headers to the csv file.
3.Steps to run:
	a. Do the mongoimport:
		mongoimport -d test -c dvv223_d24 --type csv --file '/home/2018/spring/			nyu/6513/dvv223/dvv223_d24.csv' --headerline

	b. Run the mongo aggregate queries
